# Colours
A short sample game to show how to use Kivy.

Colours is a game in which you have a board, filled with blocks of different colours.
You can switch the position of two blocks -  if a group of multiple blocks with the same colour is formed,
those blocks disappear and you get points.

This is a really simple and easy version of it, just to have a small example on how to use kivy.
