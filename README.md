# Colours
A short sample game to show how to use Kivy.

Colours is a game in which you have a board, filled with blocks of different colours.
You can switch the position of two blocks -  if a group of multiple blocks with the same colour is formed,
those blocks disappear and you get points.

This is a really simple and easy version of it, just to have a small example on how to use kivy.

## How to play

Click on a block, it'll get highlighted. If you now click on a different block, those two switch positions.
If you create a group of blocks of the same colour by doing so, the blocks disappear, and you get points. New blocks fall down.
If you don't create a group, you get a "miss". 4 Misses and you lose.
